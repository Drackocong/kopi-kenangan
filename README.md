## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository
Run the following command in your terminal to pull the project files:
```bash
git pull
```

### 2. Configure the Environment
1. Locate the `env.example` file in the project root directory.
2. Create a copy of this file and rename it to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp env.example .env
   ```
3. Open the `.env` file and configure your database settings.

### 3. Generate the Application Key
